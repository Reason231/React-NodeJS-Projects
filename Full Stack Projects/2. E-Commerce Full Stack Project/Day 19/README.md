## Frontend Part
- Go to "store" => "admin" => create "order-slice" folder
- Go to "components" => "admin-view" => "order-details.jsx"
- Import it in the "store.js"
- Note: Most of the down components code are copied from the "shopping-view" -> order.jsx
- Go to "components" => "admin-view" => "order.jsx" 
- Go to "components" => "admin-view" => "order-details.jsx"

## Bug Fix
- In the "shop" user, if i go to the "Products" then after that if I go to "Men" Nav, then that doesn't work.
- Go to "pages" => "shopping-view" => listing.jsx
- Go to "components" => "shopping-view" => "header.jsx"
