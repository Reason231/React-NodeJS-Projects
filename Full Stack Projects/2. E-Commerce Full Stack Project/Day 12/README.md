## Day 11
1. Product Cart Logic
- I have divided this section into two parts => backend and frontend

## Backend Part 
- Code flow => Models => Controller => Router => Server.js
- Go to the "models" folder and create "Cart.js" file
- Go to the "controller" folder, and under the "shop" folder, create the "cart-controller.js" file
- Create the "cart-routes.js" under the "shop" folder of "routes" folder.
- Go to the "server.js" to import the routes.

## Frontend Part
- Carts-Slice.js => Store.js
- Create the "cart-slice" folder under the "shop" folder of "store" folder.
- Go to the "store.js" to import it
- Tut video => 7:26-7:33


2. Product Cart Components
- Go to the "components" folder, then go to the "shopping-view" folder and "header.jsx" to create the Sheet in the Button
- Create a "cart-wrapper.jsx" and "cart-items-content.jsx" file under the "shopping-view" of the "components" folder
- Note: Functionality is in the next video.
- Tut video => 7:33 - 7:39:04
