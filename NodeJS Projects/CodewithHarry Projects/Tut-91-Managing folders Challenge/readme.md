## Challenge created by me
- You have to write a Node.js program to clear clutter inside of a directory and organize the contents of that directory into different folders.

- In easy words => create a new folder based on listed extension, and create the files and put them on their respective extensions.

// For example => these files become:
// From =>
1. name.jpg
2. name.png
3. this.pdf
4. harry.zip

// This (creating a folder based on extension)=> 
1. jpg(folder name)/name.png
2. png/name.png
3. pdf/this.pdf
4. zip/harry.zip

## Challenge by CodeWithHarry is that, 
- In easy words => create a new folder based on listed extension, and scan the project folder and move the files from one folder to their respective extensions folders.
